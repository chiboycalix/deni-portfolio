      <h1>THE WHY</h1>
      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>Bank call centers receive a large daily influx of inquiry calls, queries, 
        transaction requests etc. with a thousand  more customers waiting in 
        line to get a turn to speak to a human agent without knowing when they’ll be next. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, banking apps are often overly complex because banks think the more 
          features we have on the interface, the better. Without considering the personalized experience 
          customers truly desire.</p>
          <p>What if a bulk of this grunt work can be apportioned to chatbots?</p>
